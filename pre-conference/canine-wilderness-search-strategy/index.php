            <p>I have been with Massasauga SAR Team (Rochester NY), a general SAR team providing land searchers, crew bosses, K9 resources and search management, for 18 years. I am the Field Officer and K9 Officer for my team, the K9 Coordinator for the NYS Federation of Search and Rescue Teams, and a K9 Evaluator for the NYSFEDSAR. In addition, I am a SAR Instructor for the International Police Work Dog Association (IPWDA). I have certified and worked four dogs in various disciplines including Disaster Search, Wilderness Airscent, Land Human Remain Detection (HRD), Crime Scene HRD, Articles/Evidence, and Water Recovery. I am currently working K9 #3 (GSD, HRD-only) and K9 #4 (Golden Retriever, Wilderness Airscent and Articles/Evidence). My search experience has been in wilderness, rural and urban areas in NY State and New England. I have testified in two court cases as an expert witness in K9 search and odor detection.</p>
