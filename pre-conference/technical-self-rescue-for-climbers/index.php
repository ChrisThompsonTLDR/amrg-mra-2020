            <p>One day Technical Self-Rescue for Climbers program, presented by the American Alpine Institute, is an intensive one-day seminar on improvised multi-pitch rock rescue techniques. Participants study a series of haul, lower, rappel and rope-climbing systems and then apply them to a variety of practical scenarios. Individuals who complete this rock-rescue program should be able to apply these skills to a wide array of complex high-angle problems. There will be a 8:2 student-to-instructor ratio. All instructors are AMGA Certified Rock and Alpine Guides.</p>

            <p>Attendees must bring helmet, harness, gloves, rappel device, several slings, prusiks, carabiners, and a cordelette.  Attendees must have multi-pitch rock climbing experience. </p>

            <p>This class will take place on June 11, 2020, immediately before the main conference.</p>
