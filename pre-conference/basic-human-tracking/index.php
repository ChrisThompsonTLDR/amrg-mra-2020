            <p>This class will be taught on June 10 &amp; 11, 2020, immediately before the main conference.</p>

            <p>Explore the ancient skill of visually tracking humans (aka man-tracking). "Tracking is the complex application of simplicities". This course teaches the basic sciences of tracking skills. Rob Speiden will teach you, through classroom presentations and hands-on field exercises, the principles of Detecting, Interpreting, Recording and Trailing sign of the passage of humans, be they lost, missing or evasive.</p>

            <p>Topics and skills covered include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Using tools to identify and record track evidence of a particular individual</li>
                <li>Learning to see difficult tracks and sign in a wide variety of ground covers</li>
                <li>Understanding the sciences of aging tracks and sign</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The majority of class time is spent outside putting to use the concepts you learn in professionally present-ed classroom sessions. We will have a good time while exploring and practicing track preservation, situational awareness, trailing a person, and night tracking.</p>
