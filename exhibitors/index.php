            <p>Allegheny Mountain Rescue Group (AMRG) is hosting the annual Mountain Rescue  Association's (MRA) International Search and Rescue Conference at Seven Springs Mountain Resort, June 11-13, 2020. This conference is the only national conference in the US focused on volunteer search and rescue. It draws attendees from the 90 MRA accredited MRA teams, as well as many other search and rescue teams from across the country and nationally. We are expecting several hundred attendees, many of whom are decision makers and senior members in their units.</p>

            <p>Exhibitor fees are $500, including a 6x8 ft table in the exhibitor space in the conference hall and access to all conference sessions. Silver-level or higher MRA sponsors will have their exhibitor fee covered by the MRA, as part of the sponsorship contract.</p>

            <p>Up to three company representatives can purchase a meal plan for $200. To participate in any of the pre-conference courses and clinics, company representatives must register separately, unless your company is a sponsor of the particular event. We will register all of your company representatives as there are caps on registration and reserved spots for industry partners.</p>

            <p>You must <a href="https://tinyurl.com/MRA2020hotel" target="_blank">make your own reservations for accommodations.</a></p>
